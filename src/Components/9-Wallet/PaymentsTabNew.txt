P2P Sequencing

//KEEP SEPARATE BC TUPLING OF NAMES <= ***

highlevel
msgs and Thrs
msgs -> combine with names -> tuples
create the msgs jsx
combine all the msgs to display -> is this possible -> 


Just put the pmtMsgs inside the request msgs and then if passing tuples can combine
pass them separately to the build component

So the name keeps them separate but after tupling then can combine?
Then can sort the tuples in orders..
Then can pass to the build component -> 


!!! BELOW - THIS IS THE WAY !!! 

separate tupling
 add property to tuple req/msg, now its a truple ahaha
then combine all and order..
then build and choose build component from [2] .. -> 
dont need a separate chooser component just do it in the paymentsTabnew
What about the threads -> some separation -> but just let the build component sort it out ->
